// Real, relevant lifestyle photos for the German A1 lesson series — a
// separate search shape from lib/auto-image.mjs's findRealImage(), which is
// tuned for app/product screenshots ("official screenshot OR interface OR
// product page OR press photo"). A vocabulary word like "die Mutter" or
// "Hallo" needs a real photo of the actual thing (a mother, people
// greeting), not a product page, so the search query and the relevance
// check below are written for that instead — same mechanical bar (real
// downloaded file, 1080px/700k-pixel floor) and the same LLM relevance gate
// (exaSearch/isRelevant, reused from lib/auto-image.mjs) as everywhere else
// real images are sourced in this project.
//
// Unlike rescuePackPhotos() (one shared photo for a whole pack), each
// vocabulary item gets its OWN search and its OWN photo — four different
// words need four different pictures, not one screenshot cropped four ways.

/**
 * query: a short English/German search phrase for the concept itself
 *   (e.g. "mother and child", "two people shaking hands greeting").
 * label: the Persian meaning, used only for the relevance check's prompt.
 *
 * Tries progressively broader phrasings of the same query — confirmed live
 * 2026-09-08: a 3-word query ("friends waving goodbye") came back empty
 * twice running (once at 6 results checked, again at 3-of-3-words — i.e.
 * unchanged — after a first broadening attempt that only trimmed to the
 * first three words, which is a no-op on an already-3-word query). Genuine
 * broadening needs an actually shorter phrase each step, down to the last
 * one or two words, which tend to be the core, most commonly photographed
 * subject ("goodbye", "wave"). Never loosens the mechanical
 * (1080px/700k-pixel) or relevance bar — only widens what is searched for
 * and how many of Exa's results are checked (10, up from 6).
