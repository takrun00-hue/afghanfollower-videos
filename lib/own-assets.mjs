// LAW 7 (PROJECT_RULES.md, owner amendment 2026-09-13), layer 3: the
// project's OWN licensed real photographs, used when both live sourcing
// layers are unavailable — Exa out of credits (402) and Gemini out of quota
// (429), the exact outage that stopped delivery on 2026-09-13.
//
// Why this is not a hole in the Visual Truth Gate:
//   · lib/visual-proof.mjs already sanctions "owner-supplied" as a source
//     type. This module does not widen that gate, weaken it, or add an
//     exception to it — it fills the slot the gate already has, with real
//     photographs the owner licensed, not with anything generated here.
//   · Every asset still passes the SAME mechanical bar as every other
//     layer (real image bytes, long side >= 1080px, area >= 700k px), so a
//     fallback photo can never ship at a quality a searched photo could not.
//   · An asset is only usable when it carries provenance: what it actually
//     depicts, and where it came from / under what licence. No provenance,
//     no use.
//
// Scope, and the reason it is deliberately narrow: this layer serves the
// German A1 vocabulary series, where the thing a slide must prove IS the
// meaning of a word. A licensed photograph of bread truthfully depicts
// «Brot» no matter who took it or when. It must NEVER be extended to
// app-feature videos (TikTok/Instagram tutorials), where a slide has to
// prove "this app has this feature and it looks like this" — no stock
// photograph can prove that, and substituting one there would be precisely
// the «رابط حدسی / تصویرسازی عمومی» that LAW 7's own MUST NOT clause and
// PROJECT_RULES.md rule 41 forbid. Those keep using the verified
// screenshot bank (public/screens) or they stop.
