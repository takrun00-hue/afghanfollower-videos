// job that already exited cannot resume mid-flight, so news-scan.yml's
// "Chain an automatic Recovery Loop retry" step (if: failure()) is the only
// way a Recovery Loop keeps trying past one run's local budget. This tests
// the pure decision logic that step's script (lib/recovery-chain.mjs) runs —
// without touching git or the filesystem.

// be chained — that failure belongs to a human or another self-heal routine.

// the commit this script pushes does NOT start the next run. Commit 48d8c22
// was pushed by the script as github-actions[bot], modified
// .trigger-daily-dispatch, and produced zero runs in news-scan.yml or
// daily.yml — both of which trigger on exactly that path and both of which
// ran for every equivalent push made with the owner's own credentials.
// GitHub does not let a GITHUB_TOKEN push trigger further workflows.
//
// The mechanism's value is therefore the evidence and the bounded counter,
// not the push. This test pins the honest contract so a future change does
// not quietly reintroduce the claim that the chain self-starts.

// production workflows share the "gapmedia-production" concurrency group with
// cancel-in-progress: false, and GitHub holds only ONE pending run per group —
// so a single push that creates two runs in it loses one of them. Four runs
// from two identical pushes proved it is a coin flip which: #223/#228
// (news-scan survived, daily cancelled) and #229/#230 (daily survived,
// news-scan cancelled). While TRIGGER was ".trigger-daily-dispatch" — a path
// BOTH daily.yml and news-scan.yml listen to — a chained retry could be
// cancelled before running while still having spent an attempt against the
// marker's budget. The chain's trigger path must therefore stay exclusive to
// the workflow that actually rebuilds the lesson.
