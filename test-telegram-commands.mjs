// Every command the bot can receive must actually do something.
//
// `demand-research` was reachable from menu item 26: it asked for a topic,
// waited for the answer, dispatched it to GitHub — and the workflow's guard,
// which lists the actions it will accept, did not include it. The run started,
// matched no step, and ended green. A command that prompts for input and then
// silently discards it is worse than one that does not exist, and nothing in
// the pipeline could tell you it was happening.
//
// Three ways a command can be answered, and it must be exactly one:
//   · the worker replies itself (help, status)
//   · the workflow guard accepts it AND a step runs it
//   · it is not emitted at all
//
