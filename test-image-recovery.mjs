// search angles before giving up, and generateAIImage() (the already-
// sanctioned last resort, PROJECT_RULES rule 39/41) must retry once with a
// genuinely different prompt when blocked by a safety filter specifically —
// never a second identical attempt, and never a fallback beyond the two
// already-sanctioned tiers (real photo, then ai-generated).
